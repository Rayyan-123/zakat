## üìç Where to Add Your OpenAI API Key

### Step 1: Get Your OpenAI API Key
1. Go to [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
2. Sign in with your OpenAI account (create one if needed)
3. Click "Create new secret key"
4. Copy the API key (it will look like: `sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`)

### Step 2: Add the API Key to Your Code

**File**: `script.js`  
**Line Number**: `161`

Find this line:
```javascript
this.defaultApiKey = 'YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY_HERE'; // Replace with your actual OpenAI API key
```

Replace `'YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY_HERE'` with your actual API key:
```javascript
this.defaultApiKey = 'sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx'; // Your real API key here
```

### Example:
```javascript
// Before (line 161):
this.defaultApiKey = 'YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY_HERE';

// After (with your real API key):
this.defaultApiKey = 'sk-1234567890abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz123456';
```
